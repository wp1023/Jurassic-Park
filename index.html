      Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction action film[4] directed
      by Steven Spielberg, produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R. Molen, and
      starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough.
      It is the first installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, and the first
      film in the original Jurassic Park trilogy, and is based on Michael
      Crichton's 1990 novel of the same name, with a screenplay by Crichton and
      David Koepp. The film is set on the fictional island of Isla Nublar, off
      Central America's Pacific Coast near Costa Rica, where a wealthy
      businessman John Hammond (Attenborough), and a team of genetic scientists
      have created a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. When industrial
      sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the park's power facilities
      and security precautions, a small group of visitors, including Hammond's
      grandchildren, struggle to survive and escape the now perilous island.
      Before Crichton's novel was published, four studios put in bids for its
      film rights. With the backing of Universal Pictures, Spielberg acquired
      the rights for $1.5 million before its publication in 1990. Crichton was
      hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. Koepp
      wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and
      violence, while making numerous changes to the characters. Filming took
      place in California and Hawaii from August to November 1992, and
      post-production lasted until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland
      as he filmed Schindler's List. The dinosaurs were created with
      groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic, and
      with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To
      showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various
      animal noises for the dinosaur sounds, Spielberg invested in the creation
      of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats.

                Industrialist John Hammond has created Jurassic Park, a theme park of
                cloned dinosaurs, on the tropical island Isla Nublar, located off of the
                coast of Costa Rica. After a Velociraptor kills a dinosaur handler, the
                park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand a safety
                certification. Gennaro invites chaotician Ian Malcolm, and Hammond
                invites paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler. Upon
                arrival, the group is shocked to see a live Brachiosaurus and other
                dinosaurs. At the park's visitor center, the group learns that the
                cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur DNA from prehistoric
                mosquitoes preserved in amber. DNA from frogs, among other animals, was
                used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' genome. To prevent breeding, the
                dinosaurs were made female by direct chromosome manipulation. The group
                witnesses the hatching of a baby Velociraptor and visits the raptor
                enclosure. During lunch, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the
                park's creation. Malcolm warns of the implications of genetic
                engineering and scoffs at the park's design, saying it will inevitably
                break down.
